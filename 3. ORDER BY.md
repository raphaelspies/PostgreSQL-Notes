1. Use `ORDER BY` to sort rows:
```SQL
SELECT 
  select_list
FROM
  table_name
ORDER BY
  sort_expression1 [ASC | DESC],
  ...
  sort_expressionN [ASC | DESC];
  ```
  Note that ASC is the default sort, so the last part is optional
  Example:

```SQL
SELECT
    first_name,
    last_name
  FROM
    customer
  ORDER BY
    first_name;
```
Output:
1|Aaron|Selby
-|-|-
2|Adam|Gooch
3|Adrian|Clary

2. Using ORDER BY clause to sort rows by expressions
The `LENGTH()` function accepts a string and returns the length of that string. By using it, you can sort rows by length of the value:
```SQL
SELECT
  first_name,
  LENGTH(first_name) len
FROM
  customer
ORDER BY
  len DESC;
  ```
  Note that in the above example, `len` is the name given to the value returned by the `LENGTH(first_name)` expression. It could also be written as ` LENGTH(first_name) AS len`.
  
  3. Sorting NULL values when using ORDER BY clause 
  When you sort rows that contain `NULL`, you can specify where to put null values by using `NULLS FIRST` or `NULLS LAST`:
  ```SQL
  SELECT num
  FROM sort_demo
  ORDER BY num NULLS LAST;
  ```
