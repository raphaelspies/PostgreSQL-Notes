1. A column alias allows you to assign a temporary name to a column in a select statement:
```SQL
SELECT column_name AS alias_name
FROM table_name;
```
2. Combine expressions with a column alias like so:
```SQL
SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name AS name,
birthday
FROM user_info
```
Output: 
 name | birthday 
------|--------
 John Smith| 1-1-72 
 Damien Jones | 11-1-98
