`LIMIT` is an optional clause of a `SELECT` statement that constrains the number of rows returned by the query.

General syntax:
```SQL
SELECT select_list
FROM table_name
ORDER BY sort_expression
LIMIT row_count
```

`OFFSET` can be used to grab ONLY values after a certain condition is met.

General syntax:
```SQL
SELECT select_list
FROM table_name
LIMIT row_count OFFSET row_to_skip;
```

Example using `LIMIT`:
```
SELECT
	film_id,
	title,
	release_year
FROM
	film
ORDER BY
	film_id
LIMIT 5;
```
#### Pagination Example with `LIMIT` with `OFFSET`:
```SQL
SELECT
	film_id,
	title,
	release_year
FROM
	film
ORDER BY
	film_id
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10;
```
Will return values 11-20 in the `film_id` column of the `film` table.
