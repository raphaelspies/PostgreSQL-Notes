The `DISTINCT` clause is used in a `SELECT` statement to remove duplicate rows from results. It can be added to multiple columns.
```SQL
SELECT
  DISTINCT column1
FROM
  table_name;
  ```
It can be used in conjunction with other clauses/expressions:
```SQL
SELECT
  DISTINCT ON (column1) column_alias,
  column2
FROM
  table_name
ORDER BY
  column1 ASC,
  column2;
  ```
 You can also use `DISTINCT` to find entries which are unique on multiple columns:
 ```SQL
 SELECT
  DISTINCT bcolor,
  fcolor
FROM
  distinct_demo
ORDER BY
  bcolor,
  fcolor
 ```
 
 If you want to select by unique on a column and also select other columns, you'd do that like so:
 ```postgreSQL
 SELECT
  column1,
  DISTINCT column2
FROM
  table_name
 
 ```
 
 You can also grab the FIRST unique entry from each column by using the `DISTINCT ON` clause along with an `ORDER BY` clause. Which unique entry is selected is determined by the `ORDER BY` clause.
 ```SQL
 SELECT DISTINC ON (url) url, request_duration
 FROM logs
 ORDER BY url, timestamp DESC
 ```
