## SELECT

1. Using SELECT to query data from one column
```SQL
SELECT first_name FROM customer;
```

2. Using SELECT statement with expressions to concatenate columns
```SQL
SELECT
  first_name || ' ' || last_name,
  email
FROM
  customer;
  ```
  
 3. Using SELECT to evaluate arguments (like math)
 ```SQL
 SELECT 5 * 3;
 
 => 15
 ```

## Column Aliases

1. A column alias allows you to assign a temporary name to a column in a select statement:
```SQL
SELECT column_name AS alias_name
FROM table_name;
```
2. Combine expressions with a column alias like so:
```SQL
SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name AS name,
birthday
FROM user_info
```
Output: 
 name | birthday 
------|--------
 John Smith| 1-1-72 
 Damien Jones | 11-1-98
 
 ## ORDER BY
 
 1. Use `ORDER BY` to sort rows:
```SQL
SELECT 
  select_list
FROM
  table_name
ORDER BY
  sort_expression1 [ASC | DESC],
  ...
  sort_expressionN [ASC | DESC];
  ```
  Note that ASC is the default sort, so the last part is optional
  Example:

```SQL
SELECT
    first_name,
    last_name
  FROM
    customer
  ORDER BY
    first_name;
```
Output:
1|Aaron|Selby
-|-|-
2|Adam|Gooch
3|Adrian|Clary

2. Using ORDER BY clause to sort rows by expressions
The `LENGTH()` function accepts a string and returns the length of that string. By using it, you can sort rows by length of the value:
```SQL
SELECT
  first_name,
  LENGTH(first_name) len
FROM
  customer
ORDER BY
  len DESC;
  ```
  Note that in the above example, `len` is the name given to the value returned by the `LENGTH(first_name)` expression. It could also be written as ` LENGTH(first_name) AS len`.
  
  3. Sorting NULL values when using ORDER BY clause 
  When you sort rows that contain `NULL`, you can specify where to put null values by using `NULLS FIRST` or `NULLS LAST`:
  ```SQL
  SELECT num
  FROM sort_demo
  ORDER BY num NULLS LAST;
  ```

## SELECT DISTINCT

The `DISTINCT` clause is used in a `SELECT` statement to remove duplicate rows from results. It can be added to multiple columns.
```SQL
SELECT
  DISTINCT column1
FROM
  table_name;
  ```
It can be used in conjunction with other clauses/expressions:
```SQL
SELECT
  DISTINCT ON (column1) column_alias,
  column2
FROM
  table_name
ORDER BY
  column1 ASC,
  column2;
  ```
 You can also use `DISTINCT` to find entries which are unique on multiple columns:
 ```SQL
 SELECT
  DISTINCT bcolor,
  fcolor
FROM
  distinct_demo
ORDER BY
  bcolor,
  fcolor
 ```
 
 If you want to select by unique on a column and also select other columns, you'd do that like so:
 ```postgreSQL
 SELECT
  column1,
  DISTINCT column2
FROM
  table_name
 
 ```
 
 You can also grab the FIRST unique entry from each column by using the `DISTINCT ON` clause along with an `ORDER BY` clause. Which unique entry is selected is determined by the `ORDER BY` clause.
 ```SQL
 SELECT DISTINCT ON (url) url, request_duration
 FROM logs
 ORDER BY url, timestamp DESC
 ```
