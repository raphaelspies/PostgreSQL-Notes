## WHERE - Filter rows based on a certain condition
[table of contents](https://github.com/raphaelspies/PostgreSQL-Notes/blob/main/2.%20Filtering-Data.md#filtering-data)

`WHERE` is used to select only rows where a particular condition is met:
```SQL
SELECT select_list
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
ORDER BY sort_expression
```
The `WHERE` clause appears right after the `FROM` clause of the `SELECT` statement.  The `WHERE` clause uses the condition to filter the rows returned from the `SELECT` clause.
The condition must evaluate to true, false, or unknown.

## Logical Operators:
[table of contents](https://github.com/raphaelspies/PostgreSQL-Notes/blob/main/2.%20Filtering-Data.md#filtering-data)

Operator|	Description
-----|------
| =	| Equal
| >	| Greater than
| <	| Less than
| >= |	Greater than or equal
<=	| Less than or equal
<> or != |	Not equal
AND	| Logical operator AND
OR	| Logical operator OR
IN | Return true if a value matches any value in a list
BETWEEN	| Return true if a value is between a range of values
LIKE	| Return true if a value matches a pattern
IS NULL	| Return true if a value is NULL
NOT	| Negate the result of other operators

Example using WHERE with the `=` operator
```SQL
SELECT
	last_name,
	first_name
FROM
	customer
WHERE
	first_name = 'Jamie';
  ```
  
  Example using WHERE with the `AND` operator
  ```SQL
  SELECT
    first_name,
    last_name
  FROM
    customer
  WHERE
    first_name = 'Jamie' AND
    last_name = 'Rice';
  ```
  
  You can use the `IN` operator to give a list of acceptable options.
  Example using `WHERE` with the `IN` operator
  ```SQL
  SELECT
    first_name,
    last_name
  FROM
    customer
  WHERE
    first_name IN ('Ann', 'Anne', 'Annie');
  ```
  
  You can use the `LIKE` operator to match a part of a pattern or string (such as a name which contains a particular letter combo)
  Example using `WHERE` and `LIKE`:
  ```SQL
  SELECT
    first_name,
    last_name
  FROM
    customer
  WHERE
    first_name LIKE '%on%'
  ```
  Result:
  first_name | last_name
  ---|---
  Jon | Smith
  Donny | Carver
  Ronald | McDonald
  Beyonce | Carter-Knowles
  Shonda | Rhimes
  Rhonda | Kimes
  
  You can use the `BETWEEN` operator to get numerical values in a range.
  Example using `WHERE` and `BETWEEN`:
  ```SQL
  SELECT
    first_name,
    LENGTH(first_name) name_length
  FROM
    customer
  WHERE
    first_name LIKE 'A%' AND
    LENGTH(first_name) BETWEEN 3 AND 5
  ORDER BY
    name_length;
  ```
  
  Results:
  first_name | name_length
  ----|----
  Amy | 3
  Ann | 3
  Andy | 4
  Anne | 4
  Alma | 4
  Angel | 5
  Agnes | 5
  Anita | 5
  
  You can use the `NOT EQUAL` (`!=` or `<>`) operator to exclude results.
  Example using `WHERE` and `NOT EQUAL`:
  ```SQL
  SELECT
    first_name,
    last_name
  FROM
    customer
  WHERE
    first_name LIKE 'Bra%' AND
    last_name <> 'Motley';
  ```


## Pagination (Limit and Offset)
[table of contents](https://github.com/raphaelspies/PostgreSQL-Notes/blob/main/2.%20Filtering-Data.md#filtering-data)

`LIMIT` is an optional clause of a `SELECT` statement that constrains the number of rows returned by the query.

General syntax:
```SQL
SELECT select_list
FROM table_name
ORDER BY sort_expression
LIMIT row_count
```

`OFFSET` can be used to grab ONLY values after a certain condition is met.

General syntax:
```SQL
SELECT select_list
FROM table_name
LIMIT row_count OFFSET row_to_skip;
```

Example using `LIMIT`:
```
SELECT
	film_id,
	title,
	release_year
FROM
	film
ORDER BY
	film_id
LIMIT 5;
```
#### Pagination Example with `LIMIT` with `OFFSET`:
```SQL
SELECT
	film_id,
	title,
	release_year
FROM
	film
ORDER BY
	film_id
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10;
```
Will return values 11-20 in the `film_id` column of the `film` table.

## FETCH - Retrieve a certain number of rows
[table of contents](https://github.com/raphaelspies/PostgreSQL-Notes/blob/main/2.%20Filtering-Data.md#filtering-data)

Functionally, the same as `LIMIT`. However, standard SQL uses `FETCH`, so if you need database cross-compatibility, use `FETCH`.

Basic syntax:
```SQL
OFFSET start { ROW or ROWS }
FETCH { FIRST or NEXT } [row_count]  {ROW or ROWS} ONLY
```

Example:
```SQL
SELECT
    film_id,
    title
FROM
    film
ORDER BY
    title 
FETCH FIRST ROW ONLY;
```

Another example, this time for multiple rows (limit 5):
```SQL
SELECT
    film_id,
    title
FROM
    film
ORDER BY
    title 
FETCH FIRST 5 ROW ONLY;
```

Example of FETCH and OFFSET being used (returns rows 6-10):
```SQL
SELECT
    film_id,
    title
FROM
    film
ORDER BY
    title 
OFFSET 5 ROWS 
FETCH FIRST 5 ROW ONLY; 
```

## IN - Checking Values in Lists
[table of contents](https://github.com/raphaelspies/PostgreSQL-Notes/blob/main/2.%20Filtering-Data.md#filtering-data)

Use the `IN` operator in the `WHERE` clause to check if a value matches any value in a list.

General Syntax:
```SQL
value IN (SELECT column_name FROM table_name);
```

Example
```SQL
SELECT customer_id,
	rental_id,
	return_date
FROM
	rental
WHERE
	customer_id IN (1, 2)
ORDER BY
	return_date DESC;
```
Returns customer IDs that match either `1` or `2`.

Logically equivalent to:
```SQL
SELECT
	rental_id,
	customer_id,
	return_date
FROM
	rental
WHERE
	customer_id = 1 OR customer_id = 2
ORDER BY
	return_date DESC;
```

## NOT IN
[table of contents](https://github.com/raphaelspies/PostgreSQL-Notes/blob/main/2.%20Filtering-Data.md#filtering-data)

You can combine the IN operator with the NOT operator to select rows whose values do not match the values in the list.

Example:
```SQL
SELECT
	customer_id,
	rental_id,
	return_date
FROM
	rental
WHERE
	customer_id NOT IN (1, 2);
```

Is logically equivalent to:
```SQL
SELECT
	customer_id,
	rental_id,
	return_date
FROM
	rental
WHERE
	customer_id <> 1
AND customer_id <> 2;
```

## BETWEEN - Outlining a range of values
[table of contents](https://github.com/raphaelspies/PostgreSQL-Notes/blob/main/2.%20Filtering-Data.md#filtering-data)

General Syntax:
```SQL
value BETWEEN low AND high;
```

Is functionally the same as:
```SQL
value >= low and value <= high
```

Example:
```SQL
SELECT
	customer_id,
	payment_id,
	amount
FROM
	payment
WHERE
	amount BETWEEN 8 AND 9;
```

## LIKE - Matching Parts of a String
[table of contents](https://github.com/raphaelspies/PostgreSQL-Notes/blob/main/2.%20Filtering-Data.md#filtering-data)

Example using one % sign:
```SQL
SELECT
	first_name,
        last_name
FROM
	customer
WHERE
	first_name LIKE 'Jen%';
```
Returns:
| first_name | last_name |
| ---|---- |
Jenny | Matthias
Jennifer | Garner
Jenndy | Kennedy
Jen | Jin

Example using two % signs:
```SQL
SELECT
	first_name,
        last_name
FROM
	customer
WHERE
	first_name LIKE '%on%';
```
Returns:
| first_name | last_name |
| ---|---- |
jon | smith
ronald | mcdonald
bonnie | raitt
donald | duck
