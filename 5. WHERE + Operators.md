`WHERE` is used to select only rows where a particular condition is met:
```SQL
SELECT select_list
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
ORDER BY sort_expression
```
The `WHERE` clause appears right after the `FROM` clause of the `SELECT` statement.  The `WHERE` clause uses the condition to filter the rows returned from the `SELECT` clause.
The condition must evaluate to true, false, or unknown.

### Logical Operators:
Operator|	Description
-----|------
| =	| Equal
| >	| Greater than
| <	| Less than
| >= |	Greater than or equal
<=	| Less than or equal
<> or != |	Not equal
AND	| Logical operator AND
OR	| Logical operator OR
IN | Return true if a value matches any value in a list
BETWEEN	| Return true if a value is between a range of values
LIKE	| Return true if a value matches a pattern
IS NULL	| Return true if a value is NULL
NOT	| Negate the result of other operators

Example using WHERE with the `=` operator
```SQL
SELECT
	last_name,
	first_name
FROM
	customer
WHERE
	first_name = 'Jamie';
  ```
  
  Example using WHERE with the `AND` operator
  ```SQL
  SELECT
    first_name,
    last_name
  FROM
    customer
  WHERE
    first_name = 'Jamie' AND
    last_name = 'Rice';
  ```
  
  You can use the `IN` operator to give a list of acceptable options.
  Example using `WHERE` with the `IN` operator
  ```SQL
  SELECT
    first_name,
    last_name
  FROM
    customer
  WHERE
    first_name IN ('Ann', 'Anne', 'Annie');
  ```
  
  You can use the `LIKE` operator to match a part of a pattern or string (such as a name which contains a particular letter combo)
  Example using `WHERE` and `LIKE`:
  ```SQL
  SELECT
    first_name,
    last_name
  FROM
    customer
  WHERE
    first_name LIKE '%on%'
  ```
  Result:
  first_name | last_name
  ---|---
  Jon | Smith
  Donny | Carver
  Ronald | McDonald
  Beyonce | Carter-Knowles
  Shonda | Rhimes
  Rhonda | Kimes
  
  You can use the `BETWEEN` operator to get numerical values in a range.
  Example using `WHERE` and `BETWEEN`:
  ```SQL
  SELECT
    first_name,
    LENGTH(first_name) name_length
  FROM
    customer
  WHERE
    first_name LIKE 'A%' AND
    LENGTH(first_name) BETWEEN 3 AND 5
  ORDER BY
    name_length;
  ```
  
  Results:
  first_name | name_length
  ----|----
  Amy | 3
  Ann | 3
  Andy | 4
  Anne | 4
  Alma | 4
  Angel | 5
  Agnes | 5
  Anita | 5
  
  You can use the `NOT EQUAL` (`!=` or `<>`) operator to exclude results.
  Example using `WHERE` and `NOT EQUAL`:
  ```SQL
  SELECT
    first_name,
    last_name
  FROM
    customer
  WHERE
    first_name LIKE 'Bra%' AND
    last_name <> 'Motley';
  ```
