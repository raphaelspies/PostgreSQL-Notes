# Grouping Data

## Group By

The GROUP BY clause divides the rows returned from the SELECT statement into groups. For each group, you can apply an aggregate function e.g.,  SUM() to calculate the sum of items or COUNT() to get the number of items in the groups.



Basic Syntax:
```SQL
SELECT 
   column_1, 
   column_2,
   ...,
   aggregate_function(column_3)
FROM 
   table_name
GROUP BY 
   column_1,
   column_2,
   ...;
 ```
 
 1. Using `GROUP BY` without an aggregate function
On its own, GROUP BY just removes duplicate rows from the result

Example:
 ```SQL
 SELECT
   customer_id
FROM
   payment
GROUP BY
   customer_id;
 ```
 
 2. Using `GROUP BY` with `SUM` to aggregate results
 Sample Data:
 
 
 
 | id | name  | age | address      | salary |
| -- | ----- | --- | ------------ | ------ |
|  1 | Paul  |  32 | California   |  20000 |
|  2 | Allen |  25 | Texas        |  15000 |
   3 | Teddy |  23 | Norway       |  20000 |
   4 | Mark  |  25 | Rich-Mond    |  65000 |
   5 | David |  27 | Texas        |  85000 |
   6 | Kim   |  22 | South-Hall   |  45000 |
   7 | James |  24 | Houston      |  10000 |
   8 | Paul  |  24 | Houston      |  20000 |
   9 | James |  44 | Norway       |   5000 |
  10 | James |  45 | Texas        |   5000 |
 
 Since there are 3 instances of James, we can return the sum of all three like so:
 ```SQL
SELECT name, SUM(salary) 
  FROM company 
  GROUP BY name ORDER BY name;
```
Which wil return:
 name  |  sum
-------|-------
 Teddy | 20000
 Paul  | 40000
 Mark  | 65000
 Kim   | 45000
 James | 20000
 David | 85000
 Allen | 15000
(7 rows)

3. Using `GROUP BY` with `COUNT`


## HAVING
The HAVING clause specifies a search condition for a group or an aggregate. The HAVING clause is often used with the GROUP BY clause to filter groups or aggregates based on a specified condition.

Basic Syntax:
```SQL
SELECT
	column1,
	aggregate_function (column2)
FROM
	table_name
GROUP BY
	column1
HAVING
	condition;
```


Example using `COUNT`:

Sample Data:

Sample Query:
```SQL
SELECT deptno, AVG(salary)
FROM employee
GROUP BY deptno
HAVING COUNT(*)>3;
```

## Union - Combine Results of Multiple Queries

Sample Data:
![Sample Data - Top Rated Films](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/top_rated_films-table.png)
![Sample Data - Most Popular Films](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/most_popular_films-table.png)

Query to display the results together:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM top_rated_films
UNION
SELECT * FROM most_popular_films;
```
